# Timezone and Time Synchronization Features

## Overview
The script now includes comprehensive timezone reset and time synchronization functionality that automatically configures the appropriate timezone for each supported locale and ensures accurate time synchronization.

## New Features Added

### 1. **Automatic Timezone Configuration**
- **Per-Locale Timezone Mapping**: Each supported locale now has an associated timezone:
  - `pl-PL` → Central European Standard Time
  - `en-US` → Eastern Standard Time  
  - `en-GB` → GMT Standard Time
  - `de-DE` → W. Europe Standard Time
  - `fr-FR` → Romance Standard Time
  - `es-ES` → Romance Standard Time
  - `it-IT` → W. Europe Standard Time
  - `pt-PT` → GMT Standard Time
  - `ru-RU` → Russian Standard Time
  - `zh-CN` → China Standard Time
  - `ja-JP` → Tokyo Standard Time
  - `ko-KR` → Korea Standard Time

### 2. **Windows Time Service Management**
- **Service Reset**: Stops, unregisters, re-registers, and restarts the Windows Time service
- **Configuration**: Sets up proper time server settings using `time.windows.com`
- **Reliability**: Marks the time service as a reliable time source

### 3. **Time Synchronization**
- **Immediate Sync**: Forces immediate time synchronization after configuration
- **Server Configuration**: Configures manual peer list for consistent time sources
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of sync failures with detailed logging

### 4. **Enhanced Logging**
- **Current Time Display**: Shows current system time and timezone after configuration
- **Detailed Status**: Reports success/failure of each time-related operation
- **Exit Codes**: Proper reporting of time service configuration results

## Technical Implementation

### System Locale Integration
The timezone configuration is integrated into the existing system locale configuration section, providing a unified approach to regional settings.

### Registry Integration
Timezone preferences are also stored in the International registry settings with the `sTimeZoneKeyName` parameter for each locale.

### Error Resilience
All time-related operations include comprehensive error handling to ensure the script continues even if some time operations fail.

## Benefits

1. **Complete Regional Configuration**: Timezone automatically matches the selected locale
2. **Accurate Time**: Ensures system time is synchronized with reliable internet time servers
3. **Reduced Manual Configuration**: No need to manually set timezone after running the script
4. **Better User Experience**: Consistent time and date display matching regional expectations
5. **Enterprise Ready**: Reliable time synchronization for domain-joined machines

## Usage Examples

```powershell
# Set to Polish locale with Central European timezone
.\Reset-RegionalSettings.ps1 -Locale "pl-PL"

# Set to US locale with Eastern timezone (forced, no prompts)
.\Reset-RegionalSettings.ps1 -Locale "en-US" -Force

# Set to German locale with W. Europe timezone
.\Reset-RegionalSettings.ps1 -Locale "de-DE"
```

## Expected Output

When running the script, you'll see new log entries like:
```

[2025-09-17 15:30:01] [INFO] System locale set to: pl-PL

[2025-09-17 15:30:12] [INFO] Current timezone: Central European Standard Time (UTC+01:00)
```

## Troubleshooting

If time synchronization fails:
1. Check internet connectivity
2. Verify Windows Time service permissions
3. Review firewall settings for NTP traffic (port 123)
4. Check domain policies that might override time settings

The script will continue execution even if time sync fails, ensuring other regional settings are still applied successfully.
